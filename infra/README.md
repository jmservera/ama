Proposed, non-production infrastructure. The design and its rationale are in
[ADR 0001](../docs/adrs/0001-azure-architecture.md).

## Layout

* `main.bicep`: resource group scope entry point wiring all modules.
* `main.bicepparam`: dev parameters; replace the placeholder alert email and Entra group.
* `modules/`: identity, network (VNet, NSGs, private DNS), monitoring (Log Analytics, App Insights, AMPLS), Key Vault, storage, registry, SQL, Foundry, Container Apps and the generic private endpoint.
* `scripts/create-sql-users.sql`: contained SQL users for the managed identities. `scripts/create-sql-users.py` runs the same grants idempotently from the Azure CLI login.
* `scripts/create-api-app-registration.sh`: Entra app registration, app roles and secret (Key Vault) for API sign-in.
* `scripts/configure-m365-provisioner-app.sh`: delegated Graph permissions for the app the m365 CLI uses to set up SharePoint and Teams.
* `scripts/grant-sharepoint-access.sh`: optional Graph `Sites.Selected` grant for the SharePoint evidence store.

Optional parameters: `teamsWebhookUrl`, `evidenceStore`, `sharePointSiteId`, `monthlyBudget`. See the M365 section of the ADR.

## Deploy

```bash
az group create -n rg-zava-forward-dev -l swedencentral
az deployment group what-if -g rg-zava-forward-dev -f infra/main.bicep -p infra/main.bicepparam
az deployment group create -g rg-zava-forward-dev -f infra/main.bicep -p infra/main.bicepparam
```

Then run the SQL script from a host with private network access, push the
application images to the registry and update the image parameters.

For a from-empty rebuild, first set `deployApplications=false`. This creates
the dependencies without temporarily exposing an unauthenticated placeholder
workbench. Build the real image, provision the vault auth secret and seed SQL,
then deploy again with `deployApplications=true`, `entraClientId` and `apiImage`.
The flag does not delete existing apps in incremental deployment mode.

## Deployment profile

`deploymentProfile` is the general switch. It defaults to `production`, so a plain deployment keeps every isolation control.

| Control | production (default) | development |
|---|---|---|
| Network access | Private endpoints only, internal Container Apps environment | Also accepts external networks and gives the API a public FQDN (as `allowPublicNetworkAccess=true`) |
| Registry quarantine | Enabled: pushed images wait for scan and release | Disabled: new images can be pulled at once |
| Key Vault | 90 day soft delete with purge protection | 7 day soft delete, no purge protection |

`allowPublicNetworkAccess` and `keyVaultPurgeProtection` still work on their own to relax a single control in a production profile. Do not use the development profile as evidence for the private-network claims in ADR 0001.

Example: `az deployment group create -g ama -f main.bicep -p main.bicepparam -p deploymentProfile=development`.

## Development access from external networks

`allowPublicNetworkAccess` (default `false`) is a development switch. When `true`, the private endpoints stay in place but the following also accept external connections:

* Storage, Key Vault, Foundry, Container Registry, Log Analytics and Application Insights: public network access enabled (network ACL default action `Allow`).
* Azure SQL: public access enabled with a firewall rule `dev-external-access` covering all addresses. Entra-only authentication still applies. In the MCAPS subscription an external policy reverts SQL `publicNetworkAccess` to `Disabled` unless the resource group carries the tag `SecurityControl=Ignore` (observed 2026-10-08), so set that tag on the resource group first.
* Container Apps environment: external (not internal) with public access enabled, so the API gets a public FQDN. The private DNS zone for the environment is not created.

The Container Registry export policy is set to `enabled` in this mode because ACR requires it when public access is on. Identity and RBAC controls are unchanged (no keys, no SQL logins). Never set it to `true` outside a throwaway development stack, and do not use it as evidence for the private-network claims in ADR 0001.

## Disposable Key Vault for development

`keyVaultPurgeProtection` (default `true`) keeps 90 day soft delete with purge protection. Set it to `false` for a disposable environment: 7 day soft delete and no purge protection, so a deleted vault can be purged with `az keyvault purge`. Purge protection cannot be switched off on an existing vault, so choose before the first deploy. The vault name also hashes the location, which avoids collisions when a resource group is recreated.

## Tested deployment

Region notes for `northeurope` (observed 2026-10-08): Azure SQL was not accepting new servers, so set `sqlLocation` (for example `uksouth`; the private endpoint stays in the VNet region), and `gpt-4.1*` has no pay-as-you-go SKU, so override `modelDeployments` (for example `gpt-5.4-nano` and `gpt-5.4` with `DataZoneStandard`).

Deployed on 2026-10-08 to resource group `ama` with `location=uksouth environmentName=test`. `swedencentral` returned `AKSCapacityHeavyUsage` for the Container Apps environment, so keep `location` a parameter. The SQL admin can be a user, group or application (`sqlAdminPrincipalType`).

## Deploying the workbench image and sign-in

Observed 2026-10-11 in resource group `ama` (`uksouth`, `environmentName=test`, `deploymentProfile=development`):

```bash
az acr build -r <registry> -t zava-forward-mvp:<tag> mvp
az login --tenant <tenant> --allow-no-subscriptions          # as an Application or Global Administrator
infra/scripts/create-api-app-registration.sh -u https://<api-fqdn> -a <admin-upn>:ProgrammeManager -v <key-vault>
python3 infra/scripts/create-sql-users.py ama <sql-server> retrofit id-forward-test   # as the SQL Entra admin
az deployment group create ... -p entraClientId=<client id> apiImage=<registry>.azurecr.io/zava-forward-mvp:<tag>
```

Notes:

* The registry accepts `az acr build` when public access is on (development profile).
* The image carries no data. Seed the SQL database once from an operator machine (see `mvp/README.md`, Azure SQL store); set `oid` on a staff record to a signed-in user's object id so that user maps to a workbench role.
* With `entraClientId` set, built-in authentication redirects browsers to sign in and returns 401 to clients that do not look like browsers. Only users assigned an app role can sign in. `/healthz` is excluded. The client secret is a Key Vault secret named `entra-client-secret` read through the API identity.
* The API listens on 8088 and serves only `/healthz` for probes (there is no `/readyz`). The agents, orchestrator and import workloads still run the placeholder image because no code for them exists yet.
* `ZF_ENV=production` is set when authentication is on, so the map has no background until `tileUrl` is set (for a dev test: `tileUrl=https://tile.openstreetmap.org/{z}/{x}/{y}.png tileAttribution='&copy; OpenStreetMap contributors'`, within the OSM tile usage policy; choose a licensed provider before real use). The CSP follows the tile host.
* The previous `allowedPrincipals` restriction on the auth config was removed: it listed managed identity client ids where object ids are expected and would have blocked signed-in users. Access is limited by the app role requirement instead.
* For the existing MVP's direct, human-reviewed model drafts, explicitly set
  `enableApiAi=true`. This grants the API identity model invocation access and
  supplies `AI_ENDPOINT` and both deployment names. The default remains false
  for the separately proposed agent-runner topology. Placeholder worker images
  do not provide real AI to the workbench; verify a result with `source=ai`.
* `entraRoleMap` can explicitly map an existing registration's role values to
  workbench roles during a rename. It does not update tenant roles or callback
  URLs and is not proof of a completed identity rename. An authorised
  registration owner must update those separately; remove the transitional
  mapping when the new default `ZavaForward.*` values are issued.

## Microsoft 365 permissions

The runtime identity needs only Microsoft Graph application permission `Sites.Selected` plus a per-site grant (`scripts/grant-sharepoint-access.sh`, role `write` for the evidence library). Teams alerts use a Workflows webhook, which needs no Graph permission and is created by hand in the channel.

Setting the site and channel up through the m365 CLI needs delegated Graph permissions on the app it signs in with, consented by an administrator: `Sites.FullControl.All`, `Team.Create`, `Channel.Create`, `AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All` and `Application.Read.All`, plus the existing `AllSites.Read`. `scripts/configure-m365-provisioner-app.sh <app id> --consent` adds them. Remove `Sites.FullControl.All` and the consent once the grants are made.

### API registration management with the existing M365 session

The existing delegated M365 session was checked on 2026-10-12. Its consented
Graph scopes do not include application management. Being logged in does not
make `entra app` write operations authorised. Azure RG Owner and the signed-in
user's directory authority are also distinct from the CLI client's consented
Graph permissions.

For delegated Graph application updates, Microsoft's
[Update application permission table](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/application-update?view=graph-rest-1.0)
requires `Application.ReadWrite.All`, plus appropriate ownership/directory
authority. `Application.Read.All` is not sufficient to change redirects, app
names or roles. Prefer an authorised owner making this one-off portal update.
If CLI management is needed, an authorised administrator must temporarily
consent the management permission for the provisioning client and obtain a
fresh authenticated session. Remove unnecessary provisioning grants afterwards;
do not add tenant-management permissions to runtime identities.

A separate, legitimate delegated API-token request through the current M365
client returned `AADSTS65001` (consent required). That client is not an
alternative authenticated acceptance path. Graph management consent and
workbench sign-in are separate concerns: updating the registration does not
automatically consent another client to call the API, and an API token cannot
be substituted with a Graph token or forged proxy claims.

## From-empty rebuild observed on 2026-10-12

The owner-authorised `ama` reset retained the group, its policy-exception tag,
external deployment identity and tenant/M365 resources. No workload identity
needed preservation: Blob was the active evidence store, and Bicep/SQL recreated
the four workload identities and their grants. Do not generalise that decision
to identities with external site grants or other shared consumers.

Deletion has service-specific dependencies. Remove apps/jobs and private
endpoints before their environment/network, the Foundry project before its
account, and the private-link scope before its linked App Insights component.
Wait for accepted deletions to finish. Enumerate and delete resource-group
budgets separately; `az resource list` does not list them. Verify both the
generic inventory and this budget list are empty before deploying:

```bash
az resource list -g ama --query '[].{name:name,type:type}' -o json
az rest --method get --url \
  "https://management.azure.com/subscriptions/<subscription>/resourceGroups/ama/providers/Microsoft.Consumption/budgets?api-version=2023-05-01" \
  --query 'value[].name' -o json
```

Rebuild sequence:

1. Prepare non-secret deployment parameters: `workload=forward`,
   `environmentName=test`, both locations `uksouth`, `deploymentProfile=development`,
   the actual SQL Entra administrator/principal type, `enableApiAi=true`, Entra
   client ID, and the selected tile URL/attribution. In this subscription the
   tested models were `standard` / `gpt-4.1-mini` and `capable` / `gpt-4.1`, both
   version `2025-04-14`, `skuName=GlobalStandard`, capacity 30. Availability and
   quota must be rechecked, not assumed for another subscription.
2. Deploy with `deployApplications=false`. Use deployment outputs to discover
   the registry, SQL server, model endpoint and vault; do not guess hashed names.
3. Build a versioned `zava-forward-mvp` image with `az acr build`. Provision
   `entra-client-secret` in the new vault through an authorised operator. RG
   Owner alone does not grant Key Vault data-plane access. Transfer a retained
   credential only through a private file or the provisioning script, not a
   command argument or tracked parameter file.
4. Run `create-sql-users.py` as the configured SQL Entra administrator. Seed
   through the [Azure SQL store instructions](../mvp/README.md#azure-sql-store)
   before exposing replicas. Retain the continuing synthetic stock/cases and
   privately restore any signed-in staff object-id mapping. The image contains
   no fixture; a new, empty SQL database is not equivalent to the previous MVP.
5. Deploy with `deployApplications=true` and the real `apiImage`, keeping the
   same non-secret parameters. An explicit transitional `entraRoleMap` can
   preserve existing tenant role values; it cannot update the registration.
6. Wait for rollout, then check public `/healthz`, API 401 without credentials
   and browser redirection. Check SQL reads/writes and both model deployments
   from the API's own identity. Restart the actual revision and verify the
   audit writes persist. A template fallback or operator-only SQL test is not
   evidence of workload model/SQL access.

Both group deployments succeeded. The restored database has 980 cases, 443
open; the API identity read and appended audit entries; both model deployments
returned `source=ai`. Audit entries survived an actual application revision
restart. The initial health 503 cleared after cold image/auth-sidecar rollout;
subsequent health returned 200, unauthenticated API 401 and browser 302.
Worker jobs/apps still use placeholders and Decision 1 scoring is not thereby
implemented.

Interactive sign-in, live My cases/All cases and map acceptance remain blocked
by the existing registration's new callback and the operator's missing Graph
application-management permission. Keep authentication on. An authorised
registration owner must add the new callback without dropping existing redirects
and complete the tenant naming/role transition; then repeat the browser checks.
